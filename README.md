## LeetCode Solution

This repository has my practice codes and algorithms in [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/). 

In each file, there is a description in the first. And then, some methods. 

The first method is that I complete **independently** without any references. It is maybe **Brute Force** or has **high complexity**.  But don't laugh at me. Everybody is a **green hand** in the beginning, isn't it?

The other algorithms below are some better algorithms which refer from [https://leetcode-cn.com](https://leetcode-cn.com) and some personal blogs.

Codes are appended below **each** algorithms.
